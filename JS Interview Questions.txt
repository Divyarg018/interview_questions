1)What is JavaScript?
A) JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

2)What is the difference between Java & JavaScript?
A) The difference between Java & javascript are, in Java:	                                      
1.Java is an OOP programming language.	
2.It creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.	
3.Java code needs to be compiled.

where as in JavaScript:
1.JavaScript is an OOP scripting language.
2.The code is run on a browser only.	
3.JavaScript code are all in the form of text.

3)What are the data types supported by JavaScript?
A) The data types supported in JavaScript are: Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number & Object.

4)What are the features of JavaScript?
A) The primary features of Javascript are: it is Lightweight & it is an Interpreted programming language which is Good for the applications which are network-centric. On top of this as the language uses most of the keywords in JAVA it is complimentry to java language which most of the developers are familiar with.

Javascript blends well with HTML as it uses the DOM tree to intrepret HTML for us to play around with elements. 


5)Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language?
A) Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. Here keywords,variable names,function names, and any other identifiers are to be used in the program consistently & carefully.

6)List some advantages of javaScript?
A) Few of the advantages in javascript are: 
In JS Server interaction is very less. 
The Feedback to the visitors is immediate.
Interactivity is high as we can toggle the inputs inside browser developer tools and get an instant output.


7)Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
A) Both double equal-to & triple-equal-to are comparison operators.The difference between them are double euqal is used to compare only values  whereas, triple equal-to is used to compare both values and types on LHS & RHS.

8)Explain Hoisting in javascript.
A) Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top of the function. 

EG: 

function m1(){
	var a;
	for(var i; i <=10; i++){
		console.log(i);
	}
	console.log(i); //Variable access is permitted because it is hoisted	
}

9)What is the purpose of ‘this’ operator in JavaScript?
A) //Use the notes defination. (Refer diagram)

10)How to create an array in JavaScript?
A) There are 3 ways to create an array in JavaScript.

1.By using an array literal: Eg: 
2.By creating an instance of Array: Eg
3.By using an Array constructor: Eg: 

Let's see a simple code to create an array using object literal.
var emp=["Shyam","Vimal","Ratan"];

11)Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
A)JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.
For example, a variable that is assigned a number type can be converted to a string type:

var a = 23;
var a = "Hello World!";

12)What is NaN property in JavaScript?
A)NaN property represents the “Not-a-Number” value. It indicates a value that is not a legal number and typeof of NaN will return a Number.

To check if a value is NaN, we use the isNaN() function,example
isNaN("Hello")  // Returns true
isNaN(345)   // Returns false
isNaN('1')  // Returns false, since '1' is converted to Number type which results in 0 ( a number) 
isNaN(true) // Returns false, since true converted to Number type results in 1 ( a number)
isNaN(false) // Returns false
isNaN(undefined) // Returns true

13)Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.
A)Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

Higher-order functions are a result of functions being first-class objects in javascript.They have built-in properties and methods, such as the name property and the .toString() method.

Example for higher-order functions:

function higherOrder(fn) {
  fn();
}
   
higherOrder(function() { console.log("Hello world") });

14)In JavaScript what is an argument object?
A)The variables of JavaScript represent the arguments that are passed to a function.

15)What is the difference between Undeclared & Undefined Variables?
A)The difference between Undeclared & Undefined Variables are:
An undeclared variable has not been declared anywhere in the code, so said variable does not exist. If you try to read an undeclared variable, JavaScript throws an error.

An undefined variable has been declared in the program, but no value has been assigned. This means the variable exists, but its value is yet to be defined.
